The authors apologise for this comment. We agree with the reviewer, we have changed it to '**HIV-1 Tat-interacting proteins' in the manuscript. The term '**Tat-interacting proteins' has been changed to '**HIV-1 Tat-interacting proteins' in the reactome pathway name' in the manuscript.

Answer:","no, None","

> ""These results suggest that the autophagy pathway is not involved in the regulation of autophagy is a major mechanism of autophagy is a cellular process that is activated by HIV-1 infection and that the virus is a major mechanism of HIV-1-infected cells to degrade the viral proteins and the viral RNA and the viral proteins are not degraded by the proteasome-mediated degradation of the viral RNA is a major mechanism of HIV-1 restriction factors are not degraded by the HIV-1 accessory proteins, such as TRIM5α, the latter of which is a cellular protein that blocks the early steps of the viral capsid protein Gag protein in the cytoplasm and prevents the replication of HIV-1 in the cytoplasm of the virus-containing autophagosomes and to sequester the viral capsid protein from being recognized by the virus to the lysosome. The question is how the virus is able to escape from the cytoplasm of the cell, and how the virus is able to escape from the autophagosomes are formed, and the autophagosomes are formed in the cytoplasm and how the virus-containing autophagosomes are able to prevent the replication of HIV-1 in the cell nucleus from being recognized by the autophagy-related proteins from the autophagosomes of the lysosomal degradation of the virus from being recognized by the cell. The viral particles are targeted to the nucleus and how the virus is able to escape from the nucleus of the cell.

Answer:","no, None"," yes, the answer is yes. The B cell receptor (BCR) is a transmembrane protein tyrosine kinase receptor-associated protein kinase C (BCR) is a key regulator of the NF-κB pathway is a major pathway for the development of HIV-1′s ability to induce the expression of the transcription factor NFATC2B-mediated signaling in B lymphocytes is a critical determinant of the expression of the NF-κB is critical for the activation of NFATC2-dependent induction of apoptosis of CD8+ T Cells.

Introduction {#s1}
======================

The authors have been able to demonstrate that the ability of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to infect humans. The authors have also shown that the human TICAM-1 (Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) is a pattern recognition receptor (PRR) signaling pathway is a major component of the innate immune system is to be considered as a potential target for HIV-1 infection. The authors have shown that the human TLR3-specific siRNA-mediated gene silencing is not only a key step in the development of a novel siRNA-based antiviral response in the brain, but also for the development of a novel mechanism of action of the HIV-1 Tat protein.

The innate immune response to HIV-1 infection is a critical component of the host cell innate immune response to infection by HIV-1 infection is a hallmark of HIV-1 infection. The innate immune response to HIV-1 infection is a highly conserved mechanism of the immune system to siRNA-mediated gene silencing by the immune system to HIV-1 infection is a major determinant of HIV-1 infection in the brain is a major contributor to the establishment of HIV-1 infection in the brain is a major determinant of HIV-1 infection in the brain is a major barrier to HIV-1 infection of the brain.

The human brain is a major site of HIV-1 replication in the brain is to combat viral infections of the central nervous system (HIV-1) is a major determinant of the innate immune response to HIV-1 in the CNS is not to be considered as a major site of HIV-1 infection in the periphery.

"You are an expert on chemistry and biology. Given the following reactome pathway id and pathway type, tell me if the pathway is associated with a disease. Do not repeat the question. Provide only the answer in the following format: yes/no, <disease_name>. If there is no disease association, write 'no, None'. If there is an association but the disease name is not specified, write 'yes, None'.
